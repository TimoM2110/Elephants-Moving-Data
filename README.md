 # Elephants-Moving-Data
A notebook for exploratory data analysis

First, a few graphs are linked below to get an overview of the data set: <br> <br>

A few plots that emerged from the exploratory data analysis (see .ipynb scripts)

The most important things first: This is an unevenly spaced Dataset, as you can see in [this](https://timom2110.github.io/Elephants-Moving-Data/intervals_between_records.html) as well as in [this](https://timom2110.github.io/Elephants-Moving-Data/number_of_records_per_day.html) plot. <br>

[Also the amount of records differ between the 14 tracked herds.](https://timom2110.github.io/Elephants-Moving-Data/countplot.svg) <br>

[Speed distribution](https://timom2110.github.io/Elephants-Moving-Data/Histogram of speeds.html) and the [directions](https://timom2110.github.io/Elephants-Moving-Data/Histogram of directions.html) do not show any irregular pattern though. <br>

What is more interesting is the [mean speed by temperature and month of year](https://timom2110.github.io/Elephants-Moving-Data/Mean speed by temperature and month of year.html)

A HMM will be fitted in order to examine different states.
